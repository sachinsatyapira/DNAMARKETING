      },
      {
        question: "Do you require long-term contracts?",
        answer: "We typically work with clients on a minimum 3-month engagement to ensure we can deliver measurable results. After the initial period, we offer flexible month-to-month options as well as discounted rates for annual commitments."

    questions: [
      {
        question: "How do you select influencers for campaigns?",
        answer: "We use a proprietary vetting process that evaluates influencers based on audience demographics, engagement rates, content quality, and brand alignment. We prioritize authentic engagement over follower count and ensure all potential influencers match your brand values."
      },
      {
        question: "How long does a typical campaign take to launch?",
        answer: "After our initial consultation and strategy development, most campaigns can launch within 2-3 weeks. This includes influencer selection, outreach, negotiation, and content briefing. More complex, large-scale campaigns may require additional preparation time."
      },
      {
        question: "Do you handle all communication with influencers?",
        answer: "Yes, our team manages all aspects of influencer relations from initial outreach to briefing, content approval, payment processing, and performance tracking. You'll have visibility into the process, but we handle the day-to-day management."

    questions: [
      {
        question: "How quickly will I see results from digital marketing?",
        answer: "Initial results often appear within the first 30 days, but meaningful improvements typically develop over 2-3 months as campaigns optimize and gain momentum. We provide monthly reports showing key metrics and progress toward your goals."
      },
      {
        question: "What metrics do you track to measure success?",
        answer: "We customize metrics based on your objectives, but typically track engagement rates, reach, impressions, click-through rates, lead generation, conversion rates, and ROI. For influencer campaigns, we also measure audience sentiment and brand lift when applicable."
      },
      {
        question: "Can you guarantee specific results?",
        answer: "While we can't guarantee specific numbers due to the many variables in digital marketing, we set realistic targets based on industry benchmarks and our past experience. We're committed to transparency and will provide regular updates on campaign performance."
